# My PowerShell Profile

My PowerShell profile is a collection of functions that add neat shortcuts and
functionality to all of my PowerShell consoles by default.

See this [blog post](https://tseknet.com/blog/psprofile) for a detailed breakdown.

## Installation

If you want to just get started with copying my homework run the following command in
PowerShell as administrator:

```powershell
iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/thenorthie/PowerShell-Profile/raw/master/install.ps1'))
```

âš  As always, be sure you're aware of what you're downloading from the internet. You can view the source on GitHub and inspect the code prior to
downloading/executing anything described in this post. I've begun working on making my profile into a [PowerShell module](https://github.com/tseknet/tsekprofile) to make this easier to install.

## Usage

The following functions are included with this profile:

```powershell
Set-Path, Import-MyModules, Get-Elevation, Set-WindowTitle, Import-GitRepo, Install-Fonts, Copy-LastCommand, Edit-Profile, Open-HistoryFile, Get-FileHash256, Get-ExportedFunctions
```
